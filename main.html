      (July 30, 1863 – April 7, 1947) was an American industrialist, business
      magnate, and founder of the Ford Motor Company and chief developer of the
      assembly line technique of mass production. By creating the first
      automobile that middle-class Americans could afford, he converted the
      automobile from an expensive curiosity into an accessible conveyance that
      profoundly impacted the landscape of the 20th century.
